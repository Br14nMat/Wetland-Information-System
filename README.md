Wetland Information System is a software solution that allows storing information about the city's wetlands, the species that inhabit them and the events held in them.

**The system allows:**

- Register a wetland
- Register a species in the wetland
- Register a event in the wetland
- Report the number of maintenances in a given year
- Show the wetland name with the least number of flora
- Show the name of the wetlands that have a given species
- Show wetlands information
- Show the wetland name with the largest number of animals
